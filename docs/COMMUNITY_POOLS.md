# üèòÔ∏è Community Pools Architecture

## Overview

WashikaDAO's Community Pool system enables groups to save together and support each other through weekly contributions and monthly distributions.

## Current Implementation: Single Global Pool

### How It Works

1. **Join Pool** - Anyone can become a member (one-time action)
2. **Weekly Contributions** - Members contribute STX each week
3. **Monthly Distribution** - At the end of each month (cycle), funds are distributed
4. **Claim Rewards** - Members claim their proportional share

### Distribution Formula

```
Your Share = (Your Total Contributions / Total Pool Contributions) √ó Pool Balance
```

### Example Scenario

**Month 1:**
- Alice contributes: 100 STX (Week 1) + 100 STX (Week 2) + 100 STX (Week 3) + 100 STX (Week 4) = 400 STX
- Bob contributes: 75 STX √ó 4 weeks = 300 STX
- Carol contributes: 75 STX √ó 4 weeks = 300 STX

**Total Pool: 1,000 STX**

**Distribution:**
- Alice: 400 STX (40% of pool)
- Bob: 300 STX (30% of pool)
- Carol: 300 STX (30% of pool)

**Plus PoX Rewards:**
- Pool earns ~7% APY in BTC through stacking
- Monthly BTC rewards: ~5.83 STX equivalent
- Distributed proportionally to contributions

## Future: Multiple Community Pools

### Vision

Each community (village, neighborhood, group) has their own pool:

```
WashikaDAO
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pool Factory Contract
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Community Pool #1 (Kenya Village A)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 50 members
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 5,000 STX balance
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cycle #3
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Community Pool #2 (Nigeria Group B)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 30 members
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3,000 STX balance
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cycle #2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Community Pool #3 (Tanzania Cooperative)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 100 members
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10,000 STX balance
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cycle #5
```

### Benefits

1. **Local Autonomy** - Each community manages their own pool
2. **Cultural Fit** - Rules can be customized per community
3. **Trust** - Members know each other
4. **Accountability** - Local governance and oversight
5. **Scalability** - Unlimited pools can be created

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Pool Factory Contract
```clarity
(define-public (create-community-pool (name (string-utf8 50)))
  ;; Deploy new pool instance
  ;; Register in global registry
  ;; Set creator as admin
)
```

#### Phase 2: Pool Registry
- Track all community pools
- Enable discovery
- Show statistics

#### Phase 3: Pool Management
- Community admins can:
  - Set contribution schedules
  - Trigger distributions
  - Add/remove members
  - Set rules

## Key Metrics

### Pool Level
- **Total Members** - Number of people in the pool
- **Current Cycle** - Which month/period we're in
- **Pool Balance** - Total STX in the pool
- **Cycle Start** - When current cycle began
- **Can Distribute** - If enough time has passed (4 weeks)

### Member Level
- **Is Member** - Whether user has joined
- **Total Contributions** - Lifetime contributions
- **Current Cycle Contribution** - This month's contributions
- **Share Percentage** - % of pool they'll receive
- **Claimable Amount** - STX they can claim

## User Flows

### New Member Journey

1. **Discover** ‚Üí Find WashikaDAO through referral
2. **Connect Wallet** ‚Üí Use Xverse/Leather
3. **Join Pool** ‚Üí One-click membership
4. **Contribute** ‚Üí Weekly STX contributions
5. **Track** ‚Üí See pool grow in real-time
6. **Claim** ‚Üí Monthly distribution
7. **Refer** ‚Üí Invite others to join

### Weekly Contribution

```
User ‚Üí Contribute 10 STX
     ‚Üí Transaction confirmed
     ‚Üí Pool balance increases
     ‚Üí User's total updated
     ‚Üí Dashboard reflects change
```

### Monthly Distribution

```
DAO/Admin ‚Üí Trigger distribution
          ‚Üí New cycle starts
          ‚Üí Members notified
          ‚Üí Claim window opens
          
Member ‚Üí Claim distribution
       ‚Üí Receive proportional share
       ‚Üí Funds to wallet
       ‚Üí Ready for next cycle
```

## Referral System

### How It Works

1. **Generate Referral Link**
   ```
   https://washikadao.com/join?ref=ST1ABC...XYZ
   ```

2. **Share Link** - Via WhatsApp, SMS, social media

3. **Track Referrals** - See who joined through your link

4. **Earn Rewards** (Future)
   - 1% bonus on referee's contributions
   - WASHA governance tokens
   - Community recognition

### Implementation

```clarity
(define-map referrals
  { referee: principal }
  { referrer: principal, timestamp: uint }
)

(define-public (join-pool-with-referral (referrer principal))
  ;; Join pool
  ;; Record referral
  ;; Award bonus to referrer
)
```

## Security & Governance

### Access Control

- **Pool Members** - Can contribute and claim
- **DAO** - Can trigger distributions
- **Contract Owner** - Emergency functions only

### Safety Features

1. **Time Locks** - Can't distribute before 4 weeks
2. **Member Checks** - Must join before contributing
3. **Balance Tracking** - Accurate accounting
4. **Proportional Distribution** - Fair allocation

### Emergency Procedures

```clarity
(define-public (emergency-withdraw (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  ;; Only DAO can call
  ;; For critical situations
  ;; Fully transparent on-chain
)
```
